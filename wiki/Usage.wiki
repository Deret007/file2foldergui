#summary Quick outline of usage and features

= Quick Start =

There really isn't much to using file2folder:
 # Browse to or manually enter a valid directory.
 # Click the *Move!* button.
 # Complete your movie collection with the metadata program of your choice.  I recommend [http://v2.themetabrowser.com meta<browser>].

= Features =

file2folder GUI has many features in comparison to the script:

 * GUI (of course!)
 * Directory browsing or manual entry
 * UNC pathname support (network shares!)
 * Undo last move
 * Process logging with ability to save
 * Files with "Hidden" and "System" attributes are safely ignored
 * Options for auto-closing and/or opening processed directory after moving
 * Progress tracking
